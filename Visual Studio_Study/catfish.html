    <h2>Distribution and habitat<span class="tag">yeahhh</span></h2>
    <p>
        They are found in fresh water environments, though <a href="somewhere">most</a> inhabit shallow, running
        water.[9] Representatives of at least eight families are hypogean (live underground) with three families that
        are also troglobitic (inhabiting caves).[10][11] One such species is Phreatobius cisternarum, known to live
        underground in phreatic habitats.[12] Numerous species from the families Ariidae and Plotosidae, and a few
        species from among the Aspredinidae and Bagridae, are found in salt water.[13][14]
        Extant catfish species live inland or in coastal waters of every continent except Antarctica. Catfish have
        inhabited all continents at one time or another.[7] They are most diverse in tropical South America, Asia, and
        Africa, with one family native to North America and one family in Europe.[8] More than half of all catfish
        species live in the Americas. They are the only ostariophysans that have entered freshwater habitats in
        Madagascar, Australia, and New Guinea.[9]
        In the Southern United States, catfish species may be known by a variety of slang names, such as "mud cat",
        "polliwogs", or "chuckleheads".[15] These nicknames are not standardized, so one area may call a bullhead
        catfish by the nickname "chucklehead", while in another state or region, that nickname refers to the blue
        catfish.[16]

    <h2>As invasive species<span class="tag">yoyoyo</span></h2>
    <p>
        Representatives of the genus Ictalurus have been introduced into European waters in
        the hope of obtaining a sporting and food resource, but the European stock of American catfishes has not
        achieved the dimensions of these fish in their native waters and have only increased the ecological pressure on
        native European fauna. Walking catfish have also been introduced in the freshwater areas of Florida, with the
        voracious catfish becoming a major alien pest there. Flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris, is also a North
        American pest on Atlantic slope drainages.[8] Pterygoplichthys species, released by aquarium fishkeepers, have
        also established feral populations in many warm waters around the world

    <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Most catfish are bottom feeders. In general, they are negatively buoyant, which means that they usually sink
        rather than float due to a reduced gas bladder and a heavy, bony head.[9] Catfish have a variety of body shapes,
        though most have a cylindrical body with a flattened ventrum to allow for benthic feeding.[9]
